<p>The purpose of this assignment is to detect areas of large motions within a pair of images with the use of Gaussian pyramids, 
image background subtraction, and morphological image operators. Given two images from a sequence, the OpenCV/C/C++ program must
perform the following operations:

<ul>
<li>A 4-level high Gaussian pyramid is constructed for each input image (default parameters for the Gaussian mask must be used)
<p>
<li>At the highest level of both pyramids (where resolution is lowest), the two images are turned into grayscale images and 
    an absolute difference image is computed.
<p>
<li>This difference image is thresholded (with minimum and maximum thresholds of 75 and 255) into a binary image (either a pixel is black 
    or is white).
<p>
<li>The image size is converted back to the resolution of the input images using nearest neighbor as an interpolation method.
<p>
<li>A morphological operator known as dilation is used on this image (with default kernel and 25 iterations) in order to dilate the area
<p>
<li>The image is then used as a binary mask to perform a logical and between the original image and itself. 
</ul>
<p>
The input images are <a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/faculty/beau/CS3333/a1-image1.png">image 1</a> and 
<a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/faculty/beau/CS3333/a1-image2.png">image 2</a>. The resulting image should closely resemble
