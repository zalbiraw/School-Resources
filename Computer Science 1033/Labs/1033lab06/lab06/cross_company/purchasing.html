            <H5>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</H5>
            <P>You herein shall accept the terms and conditions of your order as 
            stated unless you notify us to the contrary in writing prior to our 
            first shipment of material to you.</P>
            <P>1. The prices quoted reflect our prices in effect as of the date 
            of acknowledgement. These prices are subject to adjustment to 
            reflect our prices effective on the date shipment is made and each 
            shipment will be invoiced at such prices. If any tax, tariff, duty 
            or charge now or hereafter imposed by any governmental authority or 
            agency, foreign or domestic upon the materials sold or upon the 
            production, sale, transportation, use or delivery, or is required to 
            be paid or collected by us directly or indirectly, either by such 
            governmental authority or agency by virtue of our contracts with our 
            vendors, the amount shall be added to the price stated and paid by 
            you. We may at our option add to the price of materials sold the 
            amount of any increase in transportation charges for shipments to 
            you provided that such transportation charges are payable by us.</P>
            <P>2. We warrant to you that all material sold shall conform to the 
            description and specifications set forth and shall be of our 
            standard quality. We exclude all other warranties express or implied 
            including that of fitness for any particular purpose. Your remedy 
            for breach of warranty shall be limited to the return of the 
            materials with respect that a breach is claimed and in the event a 
            return of non-conforming materials we shall have the option to 
            credit your account for any amounts paid for such materials or 
            deliver in the manner provided conforming materials in exchange for 
            those returned by you and in no event shall we be liable for any 
            consequential, incidental or other damages of any kind. Your failure 
            to give us notice of any claim hereunder, whether to materials 
            delivered within thirty days from date of delivery or the date fixed 
            for delivery as the case may be shall waiver by you of all claims in 
            respect of such delivery.</P>

            <P>3. In the event our performance of this contract is limited or 
            prevented in whole or part by acts of god, war, civil disorders, 
            strikes, explosions, embargoes, accidents, epidemics, floods, storms 
            or shortages, if due to failure of supply of fuel, power, raw 
            materials, equipment, containers, transportation or failure of any 
            source of supply upon that we are dependent, or any rule regulation, 
            order or other action adopted or taken by any governmental authority 
            or causes not reasonably within our control whether or not 
            specifically provided, we shall be excused, discharged and released 
            of performance that is limited or prevented without liability for 
            damages of any kind. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as 
            requiring us to accede to any demands of labor or labor unions, 
            suppliers or other parties, that we consider unreasonable. If by 
            reason or any of the foresaid circumstances our supply of materials 
            shall be insufficient to meet all of your requirements, our 
            contracts with our other customers and our own uses, we shall have 
            the right at our option and without liability to apportion our 
            available supply of materials among any and all customers including 
            our affiliates and ourselves in such manner as we in our sole 
            discretion consider equitable.</P>
            <P>4. If in our judgment your financial condition at any time 
            becomes impaired we may decline to make delivery except upon receipt 
            before shipment of payment in cash for such delivery. Balances 
            carried on our books on past due status will be subject to a 1% per 
            month service charge (equivalent to an annual rate of 12%) </P>

            compliance with every term and condition. This contract shall be 
            governed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey and 
            shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of our respective 
            successors and assigns but shall not be assigned by you without our 
            prior written consent.</P>
