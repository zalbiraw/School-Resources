of the town are mesmerized by a stranger named Abram Harsich. It's the middle of
the Depression and everyone seems convinced that Harsich's strange rain making
machine is their only hope. He's convinced everyone that it will solve all their
problems - only Robert seems aware that something much deeper and much darker is
going on. Why are all the children disappearing? And why are all the adults
acting like robots, using every spare minute to help build Harsich's device?</p>
