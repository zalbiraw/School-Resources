</UL>
<h2>Now to make this really interesting: </h2>

<P><SPAN class="style3">My Sisters' Place   will be 
  picking the top 3 posters that appeal to them. Your mark will <STRONG>NOT 
  </STRONG>be made available to them, but they will be choosing based on the look 
  and the content of the poster. The top three posters may actually be used in 
  their campaign as part of their marketing campaign. </SPAN><SPAN 
class="style5">TRY TO MAKE YOUR POSTER ONE OF THE CHOSEN POSTERS,  it will look 
great on your resume!</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class="style5"><A id="copyrights" name="copyrights"></A><SPAN class="style6">NOTE: 
You may use ANY PICTURES  you want FROM THE INTERNET, but if your poster is 
picked as the winning poster, we might have to replace the images you originally 
used if the organization cannot get the copyrights to it (but you will NOT LOSE MARKS on 
your assignment) . If you want to try to build a poster that won't violate 
copyright laws, use your own photography or images from on-line stockphoto 
websites such as www.istockphoto.com or www.bigstockphoto.com or 
www.shutterstock.com. or any other one you like that will give us the right to 
use the images as part of the campaign. Some sites say "Free" to use. If you use 
an image from ANY ONLINE STOCKPHOTO site where we can have the rights to that 
photo, and your poster is chosen, then we can go to the site and pay for the 
image. Don't worry about the watermark on these 
images, you won't lose marks for that if you include it in the poster. But if you 
feel that the watermark interferes with the look of your poster, then consider 
any of the options above. </SPAN><BR></SPAN></P>
<H2 class="style3">Marking Scheme For Your Assignment:</H2>
<P class="style3">  In this assignment, we do not have specific requirements as 
far as how many   shapes and effects you need to use. Based on what you have 
learned from your   labs and your first assignment, put together a professional 
poster that uses different   graphic elements/techniques (shapes, opacity, text 
variation, effects, etc.) to   create a professional poster that meets the 
requirements listed above. Below is the list of criteria we will be using to 
mark this assignment.<BR></P>
<H3 class="style3">Criteria:<BR></H3>
<UL class="style3">
  <LI class="style1"><STRONG> Photoshop File Name:</STRONG> 
  uwouseraccount_poster.psd (for example: jsmit_poster.psd) NOTE: file name must 
  be all lower case</LI>
  <LI class="style1"><STRONG>Final Poster Image Name: 
  </STRONG>uwouseraccount_poster.jpg (for example: jsmit_poster.jpg) NOTE: file 
  name must be all lower case</LI>
  <LI class="style1"><STRONG>Canvas size:</STRONG> at least 800 x 600 (or 600 X 
  800) pixels in size    
  <UL>
    <LI>If you want to go larger go ahead BUT you <STRONG>must </STRONG>be able 
    to upload it to your publish.uwo.ca website. So if you make it too big, the 
    file size of the .psd file may get very large and then you might not have 
    enough space on Panther to upload it. So don't make it too big. You have a 
    quota of about 20 Megs on panther, but some of that is being used by your 
    assignment 1 stuff (which you may delete AFTER you have received your 
    assignment 1 mark) and by your uwo email.</LI>
    <LI>Your resolution must be 72 pixels per inch</LI></UL></LI>
  <LI class="style1"><STRONG>Color creativity</STRONG>: Whether the colors 
  co-ordinate, flow nicely with the overall look</LI>
  <LI class="style1"><STRONG>Theme:</STRONG> (meet the requirements listed 
  above)    
  <UL>
    <LI>Layout: (is it crowded or or is it nicely laid out with good use of

    solid color/ blend and add images as you need them.</LI>
    <LI>You can use any images you find on the internet, either from the list 
    above or from other sites but it is very important that you include a 
    reference for each image you use (include this in the "Assignment Text" box of 
    Owl)</LI>
    <LI>Bleeding edges; artifacts leftover from an image you copied over and 
    wasn't covered up properly.</LI>
    <LI>Text: is the text easy to read, crisp, is the size of the text 
    appropriate?</LI>
    <LI>Artwork/element dimensions (are elements of proper dimensions relative

    professional way?</LI>
    <LI>Quality of images: (crisp vs. pixilated vs. blurred/fuzzy, sizing

    <LI><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Try to provide enough information to make sure 
    the public understands the issues  but also remember this is a poster, so avoid being 
    overly wordy. You must make good design decisions about what to include in 
    your poster to make it both aesthetically pleasing to the eye and contain 
    useful information that would attract someone to your poster.</LI></UL></LI>

      <LI>References for ALL images used must be cited (provide web site address 
        of each image. This is  a <EM>Reference Section</EM> for any images you 
        used.) (You will receive an automatic 0 if references are not included). <A
