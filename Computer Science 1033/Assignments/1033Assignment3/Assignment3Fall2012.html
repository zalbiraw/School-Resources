NOTE: If you decide to create button images, you MUST use Photoshop to create your buttons, you may not use button generating software. Navigational buttons/links that are very professional looking (or where it appears students have put extra effort into the look of the navigational structure) <strong>will get more marks than plain text links.</strong></span><strong><br />

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>	<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong>Structured List (ordered OR unordered):</strong> You must have some sort of bulleted list or numbered list in one of your pages using Dreamweaver (there should be no hyphens used as bullets for lists).</span><br />

    <li><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong>An  image map with hotspots</strong>:     It is up to you to think of a way of using an image map in this website.

      <br />
    </li>
    <li><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong>Well balanced text formatting.</strong> We will be looking for:</span>

        <li><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">        Appropriate size -headings, body of text, balance, etc.</span> </li>
          <li><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">        Text Emphasis - use bold/italics as you see fit. There must be at least one example of both.</span></li>
          <li><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Layout within page - should not be cluttered, should be easy to read, should have clean alignment (use what is appropriate: Left, Right or Centered Alignment)<br />

      <br />
    </li>
    <li><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong>An uppermost folder called <em>assign3</em>.</strong> You must keep your index.html home page in  the upper most folder (the upper most folder must be called <em>assign3)</em>.  The sub folders inside <em>assign3</em> can be called whatever you wish. Note though, you will be given marks for appropriate file names and folder names. </span>Also note: the home page called index.html MUST be located in the assign3 folder and NOT in a sub folder of assign3. Thus, this is correct: <em>assign3/index.htm</em>l and this is incorrect: <em>assign3/pages/index.html</em>. The incorrect way will NOT display your pages so make sure you put index.html inside folder <em>assign3</em> NOT in a sub folder of <em>assign3</em>.</li>

    <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Handing In Your Assignment 3: </span></h2>
  <h3><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="style1">Note:  you are now posting to a NEW SERVER not panther so follow instructions below and make sure you put the link to your website in Owl.</span></span></h3>
  <h2>STEP 1: FTPing YOUR WEBSITE TO THE INTERNET  </h2>
  <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to limitations on space on Panther, for the remaining assignments (this one and Major assignment), your web pages will be hosted on the Computer Science webserver. As long as you have your website sitting in a folder called assign3 on your P: drive, then anyone will be able to see your assignment simply by using the URL address:</span> <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong>http://publish.gaul.csd.uwo.ca/yourwesternuserid/assign3/ </strong></span></p>
  <p>You will still be using winscp or file zilla to upload your files but a few things will be different:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>When you run winscp or file zilla use the following information:
      <ol>
        <li>Host Name: publish.gaul.csd.uwo.ca</li>
        <li>Username: Your western username, for example jsmit27</li>
        <li>Password: The GAUL password you were sent by the computer science department at the beginning of term</li>
        <li>Port: 22 (only if you are on campus or in residence), 27 (if you are using winscp/filezilla from off campus)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>You no longer have to cd to public_html, you will be put right in the directory where you will move your assign3 folder</li>
    <li>Drag your assign3 folder from your machine (on the left) up to publish.gaul.csd.uwo.ca (on the right)</li>
    <li>You no longer need to set permissions, they should be set automatically</li>
    <li>YOU MUST CHECK THAT YOUR SITE WORKS, please follow these instructions to make sure this step worked:<br />
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>STEP 2: TESTING TO SEE IF YOUR WEBSITE IS VIEWABLE FROM THE INTERNET</h2>
  <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">WARNING:</span> If you want to check  if your site is working (all the links are correct and none of the images are broken), you MUST check it from an account/machine that was NOT used to make assignment. Thus, if you made your assignment on a home machine/laptop machine, then find another machine on campus to test the ALL the links OR have a friend test the links for you on their machine. If you created your site on the machines in the lab rooms (MC230 and MC235), then you should test your links from a home machine, or you can even test it from a machine in MC230/235 AS LONG AS YOU ARE TESTING IT ON A MACHINE THAT IS <strong>NOT</strong> LOGGED ON WITH YOUR USERID. Thus, in the labs, you could ask the person sitting next to you to check if the links work BUT NEVER TEST IT ON THE MACHINE YOU BUILT IT ON, it may appear that everything is correct but when the t.a.s go to look at your site, the links may be broken or the images may not appear!</p>
  <p><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> To double check, open a browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox and type the following web address: <em>http://publish.gaul.csd.uwo.ca/youruserid/assign3</em>. For example: if your   username was <em>lreid</em>, you would type: <a href="http://publish.gaul.csd.uwo.ca/lreid/assign3/"><em>http://publish.gaul.csd.uwo.ca/lreid/assign3/</em></a> This should bring up your home page called index.html. If it doesn't, you have done   something wrong, try again or visit a TA during the posted consulting times. If your links or images   are not working, this means you are not referencing them correctly in your   web page and should check the following troubleshooting tips:</span></span></p>
  <ol>
    <li><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You should look at where you stored the page/image and how you linked   it to figure out what went wrong. </span></span></li>
    <li><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sometimes deleting it and reinserting it will   fix it.</span></span></li>
    <li><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Make sure that all your images and web pages are within the site, i.e. within the folder <em><strong>assign3</strong></em>. If you have to move files around or rename them, do it from the Dreamweaver File panel becaus</span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">e only this way will Dreamweaver adjust its pointers on links etc.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <h2><span class="style10"><br />
    <strong>STEP 3: SUBMITTING YOUR ASSIGNMENT ON OWL:</strong></span></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="style10"><span class="style8">You <strong>ALSO MUST</strong> submit a link to your website via <a href="http://owl.uwo.ca" target="_blank">http://owl.uwo.ca</a>.</span> See below for the details of how to do this.</p>
      <ul class="style10">
        <ul>
          <li>In the &quot;Assignment Text&quot; box for assignment 2, you must put the following:
              <ul>
                <li>the <strong>first</strong> line of the &quot;Add Comment&quot; box <strong>MUST</strong> be the assignment 3 web site (include the http://)</li>
                <li>a blank line</li>
                <li>a note to the t.a. marking your assignment where your hot spot is located.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong>NOTE:</strong> you don't need to put references in the &quot;Assignment Text box this time because you have included the References web page that you built above as part of your site</span></li>
          <li>Your submission should look like this:</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><img src="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~lreid/cs1033/images/owlsubmit.JPG" alt="owl submission" width="736" height="613" /><br />
      </span><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.</span>      </li>
</ol>
  <h2><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="style1"><strong>The labs will be VERY busy because 
    every student must hand in their   assignment via a lab machine. Thus try to 
    have your assignment done and   handed in at least 1 or 2 days before it is 
    due, otherwise you might not be   able to find a free machine in the lab to build your assignment! No extensions will be given because someone could not find a free machine in MC230 or MC235.<br />
